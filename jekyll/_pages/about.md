I'm a data scientist living and working in New York City. On an average day, you'll find me hacking away at my Emacs configuration, trying to perfect a veggie stir-fry dish in my wok, reading Romantic literature, or working towards my lifelong goal of a 2000 Elo rating in chess. I created this blog to share some of these amateur passions with the world, and to get a little bit of practice with simple web development. I hope you enjoy it, and please feel free to reach out and say hello!

Moskowitz was my family name prior to emigration. The Anti-Moscow Gambit is a risky and exciting chess opening, which I do not play, because I prefer to extinguish all life from the position and win after my opponent has fallen asleep.
