This is a repository containing files for the website hosted at [andrewharris.me](https://andrewharris.me). Blog posts are written using [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) and exported to HTML using `./build-site.el`, then formatted nicely with a Jekyll theme based on [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/).
